## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it by contacting the repository admin in private, hello.embracket@gmail.com. This is preferable, since it keeps the impact from being broad. You can similarly also report by visiting the [Security](https://github.com/mikael-ros/slumper/security) tab.
